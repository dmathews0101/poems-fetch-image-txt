										<h2>About the Author</h2>
										<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Coleridge was impulsive, erring, warm- hearted. Coleridge had magnificent plans and dreams ; he was indo-lent, 
										and, falling into the terrible habit of opium, he struggled like a drowning man against the fate which seemed 
										to have, overtaken him ; he left great works incomplete, scarcely begun, indeed ; he married in haste and repented 
										at leisure ; he submitted to be helped by his friends, but he gave lavishly of the best he had to his friends, 
										and no one can read his painful biography without seeing that he so impressed himself successively on one after 
										another, as never to want the sympathy and loving help which should carry him over difficulties.
									</p>
									<p>
										He was born at the vicarage of Ottery St. Mary, in Dev- 
										onshire, England, October 21, 1772. His father was a 
										clergyman of the Church of England, and a schoolmaster, 
										good-hearted, absent-minded and impractical. The poet 
										was one of a large family, and his childhood was that of a 
										precocious and imaginative boy, who read fairy tales and 
										acted out the scenes in them, living much by himself and in 
										the world which he created out of his dreams. When he 
										was nine years old his father died, and the next year Cole- 
										ridge entered the great public school of Christ's Hospital, 
										where he was a schoolfellow of Charles Lamb. From school 
										he went up to Cambridge, and there he made Wordsworth's 
										acquaintance, but his college life was a I Token and not very 
										satisfactory one. Indeed, at one tim , for reasons not 
										wholly clear, he broke away and enlisted ander an assumed 
										name in a regiment of dragoons. It was an odd jump 
										from the frying-pan into the fire, for he had a violent an- 
										tipathy to soldiers and horses, as he himself confessed, 
										and he was glad when his concealment was discovered and 
										a way was found for the runaway to return to college.

											<h3>About the Poem</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											"How a ship having passed the Line, was driven by 
storms to the cold Country towards the South Pole ; and 
how from thence she made her course to the tropical lati- 
tude of the great Pacific Ocean ; and of the strange things 
that befell ; and in what manner the Ancyent Mariner came 
back to his own Country.'* 

The first suggestion to Coleridge appears to have come 
from a strange dream related to him by a friend, in which 
appeared a skeleton ship with figures in it. Much the 
greatest part of the story was Mr. Coleridge's invention, 
but certain parts Mr. Wordsworth I suggested
